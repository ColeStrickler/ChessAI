# ChessAI
Complete chess engine with a fully functional AI. Currently uses a beam search variant with Alpha/Beta pruning.

The use of multithreaded search, heavy use of heuristics, and a transposition table have deepened the search from an orginally achievable depth 5 with pure Alpha/Beta pruning.

On my AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core, 3800Mhz I can achieve a search depth of 9 within 60 seconds.


This is going to be a project that I will build on. I am going to be implementing further techniques to improve the AI including monte carlo tree search,
machine learning, and other optimization methods.
