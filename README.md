# ChessAI
Complete chess engine with a fully functional AI. Currently uses a beam search variant with Alpha/Beta pruning.

This is going to be a project that I will build on. I am going to be implementing further techniques to improve the AI including monte carlo tree search,
machine learning, and other optimization methods.
